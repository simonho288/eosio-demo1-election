# EOSIO Blockchain dApp Steps-by-Steps

## Introduction

This repo hosts the source codes for [my blog post](https://blog.simonho.net/2018/07/eosio-blockchain-dapp-step-by-step-part_8.html). This includes the source code of the EOSIO Smart Contract mentioned in the blog post which to simulate an election.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to setup the EOSIO development environment before compiling the smart contract. Please refer [this blog post](https://blog.simonho.net/eosio-dapp-blockchain-1/) for the steps-by-steps setup.

### Compile the Smart Contract

Type below commands to generate the WAST & ABI file:

```bash
$ eosiocpp -o election.wast election.cpp
$ eosiocpp -g election.abi election.cpp
```

### Deploy and run the Smart Contract

This requires several steps to create keypairs and accounts before deploying the Smart Contract. Please refer to [the blog post](https://blog.simonho.net/eosio-dapp-blockchain-2/) for steps-by-steps description. It guides you to run the smart contract on your machine successfully.

## Run the Webapp At Your Local PC

In addition to the above prerequisites, you'll need below software installed to run the webapp:

- Python 3.6+
- Pip3 9.0+
- (Virtualenv)[https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/] 16+
- Npm 3.5+

Install the python3 & pip3

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
$ sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
$ sudo apt-get install npm
```

### Setup EOSIO

Start the EOSIO services

```bash
$ nodeos -e -p eosio --plugin eosio::wallet_api_plugin --plugin eosio::chain_api_plugin --plugin eosio::history_api_plugin --access-control-allow-origin=* --contracts-console
# Start a new Terminal session
$ keosd --http-server-address=localhost:8899
# Start a new Terminal session
$ alias cleos='~/eos/build/programs/cleos/cleos --wallet-url=http://localhost:8899'
```

### Create the default Wallet, Keypairs and Accounts

You'll required to create the wallet, keypairs and account At the first time. Type below commands:

```bash
$ cleos wallet create
# You must record the password
$ cleos create key
# You must record this owner key
$ cleos create key
# You must record this active key
$ cleos wallet import ${private_owner_key}
$ cleos wallet import ${private_active_key}
```

Import eosio account's private key

```bash
$ find ~ -name config.ini
$ nano ~/.local/share/eosio/nodeos/config/config.ini
# find the private key at the end of setting signature-provider
$ cleos wallet import ${private_eosio_key}
```

Create the `election` account

```bash
$ cleos create account eosio election ${public_owner_key} ${public_active_key}
```

### Config and run the WebApp

Before run the webapp, you'll need to create an EOSIO config file `webapp/eosio-config.ini`. Then put your EOSIO keys & passwords in there:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
WALLET_PASSWORD = ${your_default_wallet_password}
PUBLIC_OWNER_KEY = ${your_public_owner_key}
PUBLIC_ACTIVE_KEY = ${your_public_active_key}
```

Run the local Testnet (nodeos):

```bash
$ nodeos -e -p eosio --plugin eosio::wallet_api_plugin --plugin eosio::chain_api_plugin --plugin eosio::history_api_plugin --access-control-allow-origin=* --contracts-console
```

Install the python dependencies in the first time:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/simonho288/eosio-demo1-election
$ cd webapp
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the web server:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Browse the `http://localhost:5000` to run the demo.
